LS - Web Design Exercise I

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://192.168.1.8:8080](http://127.0.0.1:8080) to view it in your browser.

### `npm run build`

Aplogize me, this configuration in webpack is required so we can navigate to src/index.html to run the application in dev mode.
